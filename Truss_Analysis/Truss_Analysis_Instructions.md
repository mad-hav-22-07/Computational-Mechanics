This file contains the instructions on how to operate the code in Truss analysis

This code can be used to get the member forces of any determinate truss, You will also get the displacement matrix. Make sure the truss you are dealing with is determinate.
Steps
1. Run the code
2. The code will ask for the number of nodes and then you have to enter the number of nodes in the truss structure
3. Then enter the coordinates of each of the nodes
4. Enter the number of members and then the Specify each member as shown in the format
5. Then you will have to choice to specify the external member forces and also the pin joints
6. After you give all the inputs then you will get the value of all the member forces.
