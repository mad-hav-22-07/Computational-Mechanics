First we will look into various methods of numerical methods in solving differential equations 

1. Euler Method
2. Backward Euler Method
3. Runge Kuta Method
4. Finite Element Method

// Get a bit more of stuff related with it, we can do a few simulatios on these things max 6-7 methods and some problems/ simulations based on that
